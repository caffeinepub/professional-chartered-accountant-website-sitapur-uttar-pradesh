  "summary": "REQ-1 appears implemented by removing decorative hero background usage and keeping the existing CTA scroll behavior. REQ-2 updates the About section to reference an uploaded JPG, but the diff does not show the uploaded image being added as a static asset. Additionally, the diff includes broader global theme/color changes and metadata/state updates not requested in the BuildRequest.",

      "reason": "The About section now references /assets/IMG-20211208-WA0020~2-2.jpg, but the diff shows no new asset file added (Added: 0). Without an added file, it is not evidenced that the uploaded photo is actually present in the frontend static assets.",
