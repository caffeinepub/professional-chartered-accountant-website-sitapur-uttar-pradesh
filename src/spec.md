# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the homepage Hero/intro background match the site’s light-blue theme and feel more formal/professional, while keeping all existing hero content, layout, and CTA behavior unchanged.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace the current Hero background image with a new, subtle corporate-style light-blue/blue-gray image served as a static asset.
- Add/refine a professional overlay/gradient treatment to ensure strong text/button readability across common viewport sizes and in both light and dark modes.
- Ensure the new background image covers responsively without distortion and remove any references to the previous hero image in the Hero component.

**User-visible outcome:** The homepage Hero/intro section looks more polished and visually consistent with the light-blue theme, with improved readability, and the “Schedule Consultation” and “View Services” buttons behave exactly as before.
