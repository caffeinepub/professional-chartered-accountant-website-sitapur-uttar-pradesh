# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Simplify the front-page Hero to a plain background and replace the About section profile image with the provided uploaded photo.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove all decorative/background visuals from the Hero section (no pattern effect, no overlays, no background image) while keeping the existing hero content and scroll-to-section behavior unchanged.
- Add one of the uploaded photos as a frontend static asset and use it to replace the current “About Our Practice” image, preserving the existing square framing and styling.

**User-visible outcome:** The homepage Hero displays on a clean plain background, and the “About Our Practice” section shows the uploaded profile photo in the same square styled frame as before.
